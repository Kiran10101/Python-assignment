### Code:
```python
def calculate_grade(scores):
    # Check if the scores list is empty
    if not scores:
        return "No scores provided."
    
    # Calculate average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    
    # Determine letter grade
    if average >= 90:
        grade = 'A'
    elif average >= 80:
        grade = 'B'
    elif average >= 70:
        grade = 'C'
    elif average >= 60:
        grade = 'D'
    else:
        grade = 'F'
    
    return average, grade

# Example usage
try:
    scores = list(map(float, input("Enter scores separated by spaces: ").split()))
    average, grade = calculate_grade(scores)
    print(f"Average Score: {average:.2f}")
    print(f"Letter Grade: {grade}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter numeric scores.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Scores**:
   - Scores are entered as space-separated values.
   - `map(float, input().split())` converts them to a list of floating-point numbers.

2. **Average Calculation**:
   - The average is computed using `sum(scores) / len(scores)`.

3. **Letter Grade Assignment**:
   - Grades are assigned based on the average using standard grading thresholds.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The program ensures valid numeric input.

### Example Input and Output:
**Input**:  
`85 92 78 88`  

**Output**:  
```
Average Score: 85.75
Letter Grade: B
```

This code can be extended to handle weighted scores or additional grading rules if needed! Let me know if you'd like to customize it further.
